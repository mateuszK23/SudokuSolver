# SudokuSolverGUI
This is a sudoku solver written in Java with JavaFX graphical user interface.

To run the program, download the zip file, unpack it, git to bin directory and run launch.sh.

I have included .idea folder to make it easier to open as project if using Intellij.

Main algorithm is based on one of my university Assignments, module's coordinator is Chris Price from Aberystwyth University.
