# SudokuSolver
This is a sudoku solver written in Java with JavaFX graphical user interface.

Running the project can be done either by getting the .zip file or .jar file.

JAR: use command 'java -jar SudokuSolverGUI.jar'

ZIP: Extract the files, go to bin directory and run launch.sh.

I have included .idea folder to make it easier to open as project if using Intellij.

Main algorithm is based on one of my university Assignments, module's coordinator is Chris Price from Aberystwyth University.
