# SudokuSolverGUI
This is a sudoku solver written in Java with JavaFX graphical user interface.

I have included .idea folder to make it easier to run if someone's using Intellij, open SudokuSolverGUI as Intelij project, and just run the program. Make sure javafx library is added to the project before running it.

Main algorithm based on one of my university Assignments, given by Chris Price from Aberystwyth University.
